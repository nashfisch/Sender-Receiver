2. Open the terminal and navigate to a directory with all the submitted source files and the Makefile. Type "make" into the terminal and press enter. 
   Navigate into the created "bin" directory. Here you can find exectutables for the server and receiver. Open a second terminal and connect via ssh to one of the 
   remote student hosts, and then navigate that terminal window into the same "bin" directory as before. In the ssh terminal, type "receiver 2000", or any port number
   greater than 1024. This will make the receiver listen for communications. Next in the local user terminal window, type "sender student0 2000", or whichever student
   host/port number you selected. You should be prompted to enter a message. Type your message into the terminal and press enter, you should see that the message has 
   bounced back. If you navigate to the receiving terminal window, indeed you can see that it has been received.
